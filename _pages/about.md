I am the co-founder of WithFeeling.AI. We are dedicated to create a "self-organizing" computational solution to bring AI to everyone. 


My research interest
======
I have always been fascinated by the geometry in the brain. Generally speaking, a brain is a high-dimensional geometric space organized in various neuronal networks. Information dynamics across networks and heterogeneity in temporal and spatial scales give rise to the complexity and signaling sequencing. By combining mathematics and neuroscience, we could better understand how the network is organized and how the information is transmitted across and within the netowrk. From here, some structures/concepts could be applied to the construction of physical and artifical network.
